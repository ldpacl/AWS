# SCENARIO

### Develop an IAM solution on AWS using AWS CLI, Python, and CloudFormation. The solution should include the creation of two IAM users, user groups, and a role. Assign the RDS full access policy to one user, EC2 full access policy to one group, and S3 full access policy to another. Each user should be added to one group. Additionally, attach an S3 read-only policy to the created role.
