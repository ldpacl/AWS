# AWS Projects Repository 🚀

Welcome to your comprehensive guide for real-world AWS implementations! This repository contains practical scenarios covering essential AWS services with multiple implementation approaches, from beginner to advanced concepts.

> **🔗 Repository**: [AWS Projects Repository](https://github.com/ldpacl/AWS)

## 📁 AWS Service Projects

Each service folder contains comprehensive real-world scenarios with multiple implementation approaches: **AWS CLI**, **Python (Boto3)**, **CloudFormation**, and **Terraform**.

| **Service** | **Focus Area** | **Projects** |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| **[🔐 AWS IAM](./aws_iam/)** | Identity & Access Management | E-commerce platform access controls |
| **[🪣 AWS S3](./aws_s3/)** | Object Storage | Cross-region replication, logging, static hosting |
| **[🌐 AWS VPC](./aws_vpc/)** | Networking | VPC peering, network architectures |

> 📖 **Detailed information** about scenarios, concepts, and implementations can be found in each service's README file.

## 🏗️ Implementation Approaches

Each AWS service project includes practical scenarios implemented using:

- **AWS CLI**: Command-line interface implementations with step-by-step guides
- **Python (Boto3)**: Programmatic automation and interaction with AWS services
- **CloudFormation**: Infrastructure as Code using AWS-native templates
- **Terraform**: Multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning and management
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual representations of the implemented solutions
